"""Seed pull requests with full lifecycle coverage.

Inserts 8+ pull requests per existing seeded repo covering:
  - Open PRs (active, awaiting review)
  - Merged PRs (with merge commit references and timestamps)
  - Closed/rejected PRs (declined without merge)
  - Conflict scenarios (two branches editing the same measure range)
  - Cross-repo PRs (fork → upstream)

Lifecycle states:
  open    — PR submitted, awaiting review or merge
  merged  — branch merged; merge_commit_id and merged_at populated
  closed  — PR closed without merge (rejected, withdrawn, superseded)

Conflict scenarios are documented inline: two branches that edit overlapping
measure ranges produce a conflicted state that a human must resolve before
either can merge cleanly into main.

Prerequisites:
  - seed_musehub.py must have run first (repos and commits must exist)
  - Issue #452 (seed_commits) must have seeded commit history

Idempotent: checks existing PR count before inserting; pass --force to wipe
and re-insert all PR seed data.

Run inside the container:
  docker compose exec musehub python3 /app/scripts/seed_pull_requests.py
  docker compose exec musehub python3 /app/scripts/seed_pull_requests.py --force
