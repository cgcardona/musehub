"""Pydantic response models for protocol introspection endpoints.

Each model names the exact entity returned by a protocol endpoint, making the
contract between the route handler, its serializer, and any caller explicit.
Using named models instead of raw ``dict[str, object]`` means the type checker
— not the programmer — enforces what fields are present and what they contain.

Wire format note: all fields use camelCase names because these models do **not**
extend ``CamelModel`` — the field names are camelCase by declaration. This
matches the existing wire format the Swift frontend already consumes.

            definition changes, even without a version bump.

            type name (e.g. ``["complete", "error", "generator_complete",
