"""Muse Hub sync protocol route handlers.

Endpoint summary:
  POST /musehub/repos/{repo_id}/push — batch-commit and object upload
  POST /musehub/repos/{repo_id}/pull — fetch missing commits and objects

Both endpoints require a valid JWT Bearer token. No business logic lives
here — all persistence is delegated to maestro.services.musehub_sync.

After a successful push, embeddings are computed for the new commits and
upserted to Qdrant as a BackgroundTask — the response is returned
immediately without waiting for embedding completion.
