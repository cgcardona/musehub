"""MuseHub blame view page — per-note commit attribution browser.

Serves the blame UI page for a given MIDI file path at a commit ref. Each note
event is annotated with the commit that last introduced or modified it, giving
musicians and AI agents a per-measure provenance view of the composition.

Endpoint:
  GET /{owner}/{repo_slug}/blame/{ref}/{path:path}

Content negotiation (one URL, two audiences):
  HTML (default) — interactive blame view rendered via Jinja2.
  JSON (``Accept: application/json`` or ``?format=json``) — returns
  ``BlameResponse`` with the full list of ``BlameEntry`` items in camelCase,
  mirroring the ``/api/v1/repos/{repo_id}/blame/{ref}`` API contract.

Auth:
  No JWT required to receive the HTML shell. The client-side JavaScript reads
  a token from ``localStorage`` and passes it as a Bearer header when calling the
  JSON API, matching all other MuseHub UI pages.

    Why this exists: musicians and AI agents need to know *which commit* last
    changed each note or measure in a composition — the musical equivalent of
    ``git blame``. This page renders each note event coloured by its originating
    commit, with inline author and timestamp labels, so a reviewer can trace
    the evolution of any musical idea across the project's history.

    HTML (default): interactive piano-roll-style blame view via Jinja2. The
    page shell fetches blame data from the JSON API client-side using the token
    stored in ``localStorage``. The optional ``track``, ``beatStart``, and
    ``beatEnd`` query params are forwarded to the client for pre-filtering.

    JSON (``Accept: application/json`` or ``?format=json``): returns
    ``BlameResponse`` with camelCase keys. Blame entries are built
    deterministically from the repo's commit history so agents can reason about
    provenance without navigating the HTML page.

    Returns 404 when the repo owner/slug combination is unknown.
