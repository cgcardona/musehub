"""Muse Hub blame API — attribute each MIDI note to the commit that last modified it.

Endpoint:
  GET /musehub/repos/{repo_id}/blame/{ref}?path=<midi_path>

Query params:
  path (required) — MIDI file path within the repo
  track (optional) — instrument name filter (e.g. "piano", "bass")
  beat_start (optional float) — restrict to notes starting at or after this beat
  beat_end (optional float) — restrict to notes starting before this beat

The implementation derives realistic blame data from the ``musehub_commits``
table. A production implementation would walk the object DAG to identify the
exact commit that last touched each note; at API contract scope, the seed data
is generated deterministically from the commit history so the UI page has a
realistic dataset to render.

Auth: public repos allow unauthenticated access (``optional_token``); private
repos require a valid JWT Bearer token.
