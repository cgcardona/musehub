"""Qdrant client for MuseHub semantic search — vector upsert and similarity queries.

Manages a dedicated Qdrant collection (``musehub_compositions``) separate from
the RAG docs collection used by the reasoning pipeline. Each point in the
collection represents a single Muse Hub commit and carries:

  - A 128-dim musical feature vector (see musehub_embeddings.py)
  - Payload metadata: repo_id, commit_id, is_public, branch, author

Boundary rules (same as other musehub services):
  - Must NOT import state stores, SSE queues, or LLM clients.
  - Must NOT import musehub.core.* modules.
  - May import from musehub.services.musehub_embeddings.
  - Wraps qdrant_client at the boundary with typed results.

Public factory
--------------
``get_qdrant_client()`` is an ``@lru_cache``-backed factory that returns the
process-level singleton. Inject it via ``Depends(get_qdrant_client)`` in
FastAPI route handlers so the dependency is explicit, overridable in tests via
``app.dependency_overrides``, and never leaks global mutable state.
