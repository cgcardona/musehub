"""Muse Hub activity event service — single point of access for the event stream.

This module is the ONLY place that touches the ``musehub_events`` table.
Route handlers record events atomically alongside their primary action (e.g.
a commit push records both the commit row and a ``commit_pushed`` event in the
same DB transaction).

Boundary rules:
- Must NOT import state stores, SSE queues, or LLM clients.
- Must NOT import musehub.core.* modules.
- May import ORM models from musehub.db.musehub_models.
- May import Pydantic response models from musehub.models.musehub.

Event type vocabulary
---------------------
commit_pushed — a commit was pushed to the repo
pr_opened — a pull request was opened
pr_merged — a pull request was merged
pr_closed — a pull request was closed without merge
issue_opened — an issue was opened
issue_closed — an issue was closed
branch_created — a new branch was created
branch_deleted — a branch was deleted
tag_pushed — a tag was pushed
session_started — a recording session was started
session_ended — a recording session was ended
