"""MuseHub release packager — builds download package URL maps for releases.

A release exposes music files in multiple formats so musicians and listeners
can download the composition in their preferred format:

- ``midi_bundle`` — full arrangement as a single MIDI file
- ``stems`` — individual track stems as a zip of .mid files
- ``mp3`` — full mix audio render
- ``musicxml`` — notation export in MusicXML format
- ``metadata`` — JSON manifest with tempo, key, and arrangement info

At MVP these URLs are deterministic paths served by the object download
endpoint (``GET /api/v1/repos/{repo_id}/objects/{object_id}/content``).
For releases that don't have a pinned commit or whose commit has no stored
objects, the URLs are ``None`` — the frontend renders "not available" for those
entries.

This module contains NO database access. It operates purely on the release
and repo identifiers to construct URL strings.

    Args:
        repo_id: The UUID of the MuseHub repo.
