"""Pydantic v2 models for the MuseHub Analysis API and Dynamics Page.

Each musical dimension has a dedicated typed data model. All models are
consumed by AI agents and must be fully described so agents can reason
about musical properties programmatically.

Dimensions supported (13 total):
  harmony, dynamics, motifs, form, groove, emotion, chord-map,
  contour, key, tempo, meter, similarity, divergence

Every endpoint returns an :class:`AnalysisResponse` envelope whose ``data``
field is one of the dimension-specific ``*Data`` models below. The
aggregate endpoint returns :class:`AggregateAnalysisResponse` containing
one ``AnalysisResponse`` per dimension.

Design contract:
- CamelCase on the wire (via :class:`~musehub.models.base.CamelModel`).
- All float fields are rounded to 4 decimal places in the service layer.
- Stub data is deterministic for a given ``ref`` value.
- ``filters_applied`` records which query-param filters were active so
  agents can tell whether the result is narrowed or full-spectrum.
